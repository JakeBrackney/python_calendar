# Python Calendar

This app is built in Python and Django. Our intention is to build a limited functional clone of Google Calendars. Using Django authentication, users will be able to sign up/log in, create events on the calendar, with the option to update and delete events. 

The app is under construction, but feel free to peek through our code.
